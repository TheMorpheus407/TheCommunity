# 1. Introduction and Goals

## 1.1 Requirements Overview

### What is TheCommunity?

TheCommunity is a **fully peer-to-peer WebRTC chat application** with a revolutionary constraint: **no backend server and no signaling broker**. It demonstrates true serverless, peer-to-peer communication where users manually exchange WebRTC signals to establish direct browser-to-browser connections.

### Key Features

#### Core Chat Features
- **Real-time P2P Messaging**: Direct browser-to-browser text communication via WebRTC DataChannels
- **Manual Signaling**: Users copy-paste SDP offers and answers to establish connections
- **Message History**: Visual distinction between own messages, peer messages, and system notices
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against message flooding (max 30 messages per 5-second interval)
- **Message Validation**: Client-side validation for message length (max 2000 characters) and format

#### Screen Collaboration
- **Screen Sharing**: Stream your screen peer-to-peer with zero server involvement
- **Remote Control**: Permissioned remote mouse and keyboard control with explicit opt-in/opt-out
- **Image Transfer**: Chunked transfer of images up to 5MB via dedicated data channel

#### User Experience
- **Light/Dark Theme**: System preference detection with manual toggle and localStorage persistence
- **Multi-language Support**: Multiple German dialect variations
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Audio Easter Eggs**: Background soundtrack and Konami code activation

#### AI Integration (Optional)
- **AI Draft Assistance**: OpenAI-powered message rewriting using user-provided API key
- **Client-side Only**: API key stored in memory, sent only to api.openai.com
- **User-controlled**: Completely optional feature with clear usage warnings

### Community-Driven Development

The project direction is **entirely steered by the community** through GitHub Issues. What started as a chat application may evolve into something completely different based on community contributions and ideas.

## 1.2 Quality Goals

The three most important quality goals for TheCommunity, ordered by priority:

### 1. **Security and Privacy** (Priority 1)

| Quality Goal | Motivation |
|--------------|------------|
| No backend communication (except WebRTC) | Core constraint: All chat communication must be peer-to-peer with no traditional server |
| Rate limiting and input validation | Protect against abuse and malicious input |
| No credential storage | User privacy: no localStorage for sensitive data, no cookies |
| Channel isolation | Security: reject unexpected WebRTC data channels |
| Transparent network exposure | Users must be warned that WebRTC reveals network addresses |

### 2. **Reliability and Stability** (Priority 2)

| Quality Goal | Motivation |
|--------------|------------|
| Zero breaking changes | App is live via GitHub Actions; changes must not break production |
| Graceful degradation | Connection failures, API errors must be handled without crashes |
| Browser compatibility | Support Chrome 56+, Firefox 44+, Safari 11+, Edge 79+ |
| Performance targets | DOMContentLoaded < 2s, Fully Loaded < 5s, First Paint < 1s |

### 3. **Maintainability and Extensibility** (Priority 3)

| Quality Goal | Motivation |
|--------------|------------|
| Clean, modular architecture | Enable community contributions and feature evolution |
| Comprehensive documentation | Lower barrier to entry for new contributors |
| Progressive refactoring | Incremental migration from monolithic to modular structure |
| No build step required | Keep development simple with native ES6 modules |

## 1.3 Stakeholders

### Overview

| Role/Name | Expectations |
|-----------|--------------|
| **End Users** | Simple, secure P2P chat without servers or accounts |
| **Community Contributors** | Clear architecture, easy to add features via Issues/PRs |
| **Project Maintainers** | Maintainable codebase, no breaking changes, security-first |
| **Privacy Advocates** | No data collection, no tracking, transparent about network exposure |
| **AI Assistant (Claude)** | Follow CLAUDE.md guidelines, maintain clean code, create PRs for Issues |

### Detailed Stakeholder Interests

#### End Users
- **Goals**: Communicate privately without creating accounts or trusting servers
- **Concerns**: Ease of use (manual signaling is complex), browser compatibility, connection reliability
- **Expectations**: Messages just work, clear connection status, no data leaks

#### Community Contributors
- **Goals**: Add features, fix bugs, learn WebRTC, shape project direction
- **Concerns**: Code quality, documentation clarity, review speed, issue prioritization
- **Expectations**: Welcoming contribution process, clear guidelines (CLAUDE.md), architecture documentation

#### Project Maintainers (TheMorpheus407)
- **Goals**: Stable live application, community-driven evolution, showcase WebRTC
- **Concerns**: Breaking changes, security vulnerabilities, technical debt, code quality
- **Expectations**: All PRs maintain stability, follow guidelines, include tests and documentation

#### Privacy Advocates
- **Goals**: Promote decentralized, server-free communication
- **Concerns**: Hidden tracking, credential harvesting, misleading privacy claims
- **Expectations**: Transparent documentation, no analytics, open-source verifiability

#### AI Assistant (Claude via GitHub Action)
- **Goals**: Implement Issues following CLAUDE.md rules, maintain architecture, create clean PRs
- **Concerns**: Understanding project constraints, security implications, code quality standards
- **Expectations**: Access to architecture docs, clear issue descriptions, permission to explore solutions

## 1.4 Success Criteria

TheCommunity is successful when:

1. **Functional**: Users can establish P2P connections and chat reliably
2. **Secure**: No security vulnerabilities in production for 12+ months
3. **Community-Driven**: At least 50% of features come from community Issues
4. **Stable**: Zero downtime deployments via GitHub Actions
5. **Documented**: New contributors can understand architecture within 1 hour of reading docs
6. **Performant**: 95% of page loads meet performance targets (< 2s DOMContentLoaded)
7. **Private**: Zero data collection, zero tracking, zero backend storage

## 1.5 Non-Goals

What TheCommunity explicitly does NOT aim to be:

- ❌ **Enterprise chat solution**: No user management, no persistence, no admin features
- ❌ **WhatsApp replacement**: Manual signaling is intentionally complex; not for mainstream users
- ❌ **Encrypted messenger**: No end-to-end encryption layer (though WebRTC uses DTLS)
- ❌ **Multi-peer mesh network**: Currently supports only 1-to-1 connections
- ❌ **Mobile app**: Web-only, no native mobile apps planned
- ❌ **Production-ready platform**: Educational/experimental project, use at own risk
