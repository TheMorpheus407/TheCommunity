# TheCommunity - Architecture Documentation (arc42)

This directory contains the architecture documentation for TheCommunity, structured according to the arc42 template.

## About arc42

arc42 is a proven template for software architecture documentation and communication. It provides a standardized structure for documenting and communicating software architectures.

## Documentation Structure

The architecture documentation is organized into the following sections:

1. [Introduction and Goals](01-introduction-and-goals.md) - Requirements overview, quality goals, and stakeholders
2. [Architecture Constraints](02-architecture-constraints.md) - Technical and organizational constraints
3. [System Scope and Context](03-system-scope-and-context.md) - Business and technical context
4. [Solution Strategy](04-solution-strategy.md) - Fundamental solution decisions
5. [Building Block View](05-building-block-view.md) - Static decomposition of the system
6. [Runtime View](06-runtime-view.md) - Runtime behavior and scenarios
7. [Deployment View](07-deployment-view.md) - Technical infrastructure
8. [Cross-cutting Concepts](08-cross-cutting-concepts.md) - Overall, application-wide concepts
9. [Architecture Decisions](09-architecture-decisions.md) - Important decisions with rationale
10. [Quality Requirements](10-quality-requirements.md) - Quality scenarios and requirements
11. [Risks and Technical Debt](11-risks-and-technical-debt.md) - Known risks and technical debt
12. [Glossary](12-glossary.md) - Important domain and technical terms

## Quick Navigation

### For New Developers
Start with:
- [Introduction and Goals](01-introduction-and-goals.md) to understand what TheCommunity is about
- [Solution Strategy](04-solution-strategy.md) to learn the fundamental approach
- [Building Block View](05-building-block-view.md) to understand the code structure

### For Technical Decision Makers
Focus on:
- [Architecture Constraints](02-architecture-constraints.md) to understand the limitations
- [Architecture Decisions](09-architecture-decisions.md) to review key decisions
- [Quality Requirements](10-quality-requirements.md) to understand non-functional requirements
- [Risks and Technical Debt](11-risks-and-technical-debt.md) to assess current risks

### For Operations/DevOps
Review:
- [Deployment View](07-deployment-view.md) for infrastructure details
- [System Scope and Context](03-system-scope-and-context.md) for external dependencies

## How to Read This Documentation

Each section is self-contained and can be read independently, though sections may reference each other. The documentation uses:

- **Diagrams**: ASCII art and markdown-friendly diagrams for portability
- **Code Examples**: Actual code snippets from the codebase
- **Cross-references**: Links to other sections and source files

## Maintaining This Documentation

When making architectural changes:

1. Update the relevant arc42 section(s)
2. Update diagrams if structure changes
3. Document new decisions in [Architecture Decisions](09-architecture-decisions.md)
4. Update [Risks and Technical Debt](11-risks-and-technical-debt.md) if introducing technical debt
5. Keep [Glossary](12-glossary.md) up to date with new terms
